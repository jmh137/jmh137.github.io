My research lies at the intersection of cosmology, particle physics and particle astrophysics. My current emphasis is neutrino astrophysics and how existing and upcoming detectors can reveal neutrino properties and answer interesting questions about the universe. I have also worked with students on observations of double star systems. <br> <br>
