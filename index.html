I'm a physicist and visiting assistant professor doing research at the intersection of cosmology, particle physics and particle astrophysics. My current focus is on neutrino astrophysics: how can existing and upcoming detectors reveal neutrino properties and answer interesting questions about the universe? I have also worked on other topics in early universe cosmology, and observations of double star systems. If you are a student, there are always opportunities to work on a research project!<br> <br>

I am passionate about physics and astronomy education, especially realistic problem-solving, computation, and analysis of data. I have developed new courses and class activities, and have published an article on one of these. See my teaching page for more info!<br> <br>

When I'm not doing physics, I enjoy running marathons and being walked by my dog.
