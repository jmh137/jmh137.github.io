<h1>Jeff Hyde</h1>
<p>I'm a physicist and visiting assistant professor doing research at the intersection of cosmology, particle physics and particle astrophysics. My current focus is on neutrino astrophysics: how can existing and upcoming detectors reveal neutrino properties and answer interesting questions about the universe? I have also published on observations of double star systems. If you are a student, there are opportunities to work on a research project in any of these areas.</p>

<p>I am passionate about physics and astronomy education, especially realistic problem-solving, computation, and analysis of data. I have developed new courses with these goals in mind, and published an article on one of them. See my teaching page for more info!</p>
