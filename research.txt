Research
[Intro / Description] My research lies at the intersection of cosmology, particle physics and particle astrophysics. The current emphasis is neutrino astrophysics and how existing and upcoming detectors can reveal neutrino properties and answer interesting questions about the universe. I have also worked with students on observations of double star systems. Talk from 28th International Workshop on Weak Interactions and Neutrinos (WIN 2021) [nu SI white paper when it's done] 
Student Projects:
If you are a student interested in an independent study or research project, please send me an email or stop by my office! I would be happy to hear about your interests and discuss research ideas with you. Past student projects leading to a paper or thesis: Matthew Saveliev (Bowdoin '23) paper: "Using Secondary Tau Neutrinos to Probe Heavy Dark Matter Decays" arXiv:2108.13412 Grace Kirkpatrick & Amanda Smith (Bowdoin '23) paper: "New Observation and Physical Nature of Double Star WDS 23134-7821 AB" To Appear in Journal of Double Star Observations David Zhou (Bowdoin '21) Honors Thesis: "Cosmological Gravitational Waves: Refining a General Rule of Thumb for Reheating" at https://digitalcommons.bowdoin.edu/honorsprojects/273/
